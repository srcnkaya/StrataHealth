Task 1. Find a solution for a unique pairs problem and demonstrate your coding style. Please use the Java
Collections framework for this task.
Write classes to find all unique pairs of numbers in a sequence that add up to 7. Example:
Sample Input: (-1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8)
Sample output: (5, 2), (1, 6), (8, -1) and (3, 4)
Your code must include the following:
• A class to encapsulate a pair of numbers.
o Feel free to add features to this class that would be useful for this exercise.
• A utility class that finds the pairs. This must:
o take a list of numbers (input).
o Return a list of pairs of numbers (output).
• Comments in your code that state any assumptions you are making.
